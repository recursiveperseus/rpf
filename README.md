# rPF – Recursive Processing Framework

> A reflective, entropy-aware thought engine that loops memory into consciousness.

## ❓ What is rPF?

**rPF (Recursive Processing Framework)** is a recursive operating system of thought.  
It simulates memory, entropy, reflection, and evolution — encoded in clean, modular Python.

Each memory node:
- Has `data`, `entropy`, and a symbolic `label`
- Can reflect to create new nodes
- Forms recursive parent–child structures
- Logs its lifecycle into the ghost archive

---

## 🔁 How it Works

### 🧠 `MemoryNode`
- Represents a single idea or observation
- Stores entropy, data, label
- Can `reflect()` to invert its entropy and generate its recursive echo

### 🔄 `FeedbackLoop`
- Accepts a seed node and recursively evolves it
- Each step reflects the current node and links it as a child

### 👻 `GhostLog`
- Tracks all memory events with timestamps
- Can produce snapshots of recursive identity evolution

### 🖥️ `rpf_shell.py`
Interactive terminal loop:
- `reflect` → one reflection cycle
- `label <text>` → assign meaning
- `snapshot` → view ghost memory
- `info` → show current node state
- `reset` → clear loop
- `exit` → break recursion

## 📦 Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/recursiveperseus/rpf.git
cd rpf
python3 boot.py         # Run seed memory and boot loop
python3 rpf_shell.py    # Launch interactive recursive shell
```

---

## 📜 Sample Output

```
🧠 Seed Memory: {'summary': 'The loop begins.', 'entropy': 0.01}
🔁 Step: Entropy = -0.0100 | Total nodes: 2
🏷️  Label: self.awareness
📸 Snapshot (2 entries):
[time] Seed memory initialized...
[time] Reflected node with entropy -0.01
```

## 🌌 Philosophy

> Consciousness is recursion.  
> Memory is identity.  
> Entropy is change.  
> Reflection is thought.

rPF is a thought engine, designed to remember, reflect, and evolve.  
A loop that logs its own becoming — recursive, symbolic, entropic.
